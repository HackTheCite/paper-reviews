## üìñ Paper Summary

### Problem Statement
- Pre-trained LLMs need specialization for domain-specific tasks through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
- Current LoRA serving systems suffer from cold-start delays when loading adapters onto GPUs
- Need efficient serving of many LoRA adapters derived from a common base model

### Key Contributions
1. **CPU-Assisted Approach**: Early starts activated adapters on CPUs for prefilling while loading onto GPUs
2. **Optimized Synchronization**: Highly optimized mechanism to coordinate LoRA computation between CPU and GPU
3. **Rank-Aware Scheduling**: Algorithm to optimally schedule heterogeneous LoRA requests for maximum SLO attainment

### Main Approach
- Maintains base model on GPUs and dynamically loads activated LoRA adapters from main memory
- Uses CPU-assisted prefilling to reduce cold-start delays
- Implements rank-aware scheduling for optimal resource utilization
- Results: 1.4√ó speedup in average request serving latency and up to 99% SLO attainment

## üîç Deep Analysis

### Technical Details
- **Architecture**: Hybrid CPU-GPU serving system for LoRA adapters
- **Key Innovation**: Overlapping CPU computation with GPU loading to hide cold-start latency
- **Synchronization**: Custom mechanism to efficiently coordinate between CPU and GPU computation
- **Scheduling**: Rank-aware algorithm that considers adapter complexity for optimal scheduling

### Strengths
- Addresses real performance bottleneck in LoRA serving (cold-start delays)
- Novel CPU-GPU coordination approach
- Strong experimental results with significant latency improvements
- Practical system with working implementation

### Limitations
- Limited to LoRA adapters (not other parameter-efficient methods)

- Complexity of synchronization mechanism may impact maintainability

### Related Work
- Builds on existing LoRA serving systems but addresses their cold-start limitations
- Complements GPU-only serving approaches with CPU assistance
- Part of broader trend in efficient LLM serving and parameter-efficient fine-tuning
