# 🧠 Hack the Cite

> **Hack** = Analyze, build, implement  
> **Cite** = Academic papers and research literature  

Welcome to **Hack the Cite** — where we take cutting-edge academic papers, dive deep into understanding them, and hack on the ideas to make them real.

## 🎯 Mission

We read the best papers, deeply analyze the ideas, and build practical implementations. Our approach is methodical and intellectually rigorous, always grounded in real research literature from arXiv, conferences, and journals.

## 🔬 Our Process

1. **Read** - Deep dive into the paper
2. **Analyze** - Break down the key contributions and methods
3. **Implement** - Build and test the core ideas
4. **Iterate** - Experiment, extend, and improve
5. **Write** - Document our learnings in a comprehensive review

Each paper gets its own directory with everything contained within it.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Use the template in `templates/` to start reviewing a new paper.
